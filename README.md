Features:
----------------

Access Local Mobile Phone Contact List:

The application provides functionality to access and display the user's local mobile phone contact list.
This feature is implemented similarly to how messaging apps like WhatsApp access and display contacts.

Profile Picture Editing:

Users can update their profile pictures through two options available in the app's drawer menu:
Select from Gallery: Users can choose an existing photo from their device's gallery.
Take a Picture: Users can capture a new photo using the device's camera.
This feature enhances the user experience by allowing flexible and convenient profile picture updates.

Multilingual Support:

The application supports multiple languages, making it accessible to a wider audience.
At least two different languages are supported, with the entire app translated accordingly.
This ensures that users can navigate and use the app in their preferred language, improving usability and user satisfaction
