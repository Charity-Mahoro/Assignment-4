Access Local Mobile Phone Contact List:

The application provides functionality to access and display the user's local mobile phone contact list.
This feature is implemented similarly to how messaging apps like WhatsApp access and display contacts.
Profile Picture Editing:

Users can update their profile pictures through two options available in the app's drawer menu:
